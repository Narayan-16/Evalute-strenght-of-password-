##  Best Practices Learned
- Use long passwords (12+ characters)
- Mix upper/lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid dictionary words or predictable patterns
- Use passphrases (e.g. "Coffee#IsLife!2025")
- Use password managers to generate/store unique passwords

##  Password Attack Types
- *Brute Force:* tries all possible combinations
- *Dictionary Attack:* uses common wordlists

## Summary
Strong passwords drastically increase the time required for an attacker to guess them, especially against brute-force and dictionary attacks. Using symbols, unpredictability, and length is key to staying secure.
